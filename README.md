Disease Detection in Cashew Plant Leaves

Overview:

This project focuses on detecting diseases in cashew plant leaves using machine learning (ML) and deep learning models. The goal is to identify and classify leaf diseases early to prevent crop loss and ensure healthy yields.

Models Used:

1) Support Vector Machine (SVM): A traditional ML model used for classifying leaf health status.

2) MobileNet: A lightweight CNN model optimized for mobile applications, used for real-time disease detection.

3) InceptionV3: A deep CNN model that captures features at multiple scales, enhancing detection accuracy.

4) ResNet: A deep CNN model with skip connections, improving robustness and precision in disease detection.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Image augmentation techniques like rotation and flipping are applied to improve model generalization.
Training: SVM uses handcrafted features, while CNN models use transfer learning with pre-trained weights for efficient training.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with confusion matrices for performance visualization.

Results:

Deep learning models, especially MobileNet and ResNet, outperform traditional ML models in detecting cashew leaf diseases, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in agricultural applications.

Conclusion:

The project shows that advanced CNN architectures are highly effective for cashew leaf disease detection, offering a reliable tool for farmers and agronomists.

Future Work:

Future improvements could include expanding the dataset, exploring new CNN models, and developing a mobile application for real-time field use.
